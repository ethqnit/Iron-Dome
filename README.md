# Iron Dome – Missile Defense Learning Prototype

**A 2D ballistic missile interceptor game built in Godot 3.5 using C#**  
Click (or tap) to launch counter-missiles that predict and destroy incoming threats before they reach the ground.

This was a **learning project** I built while taking GameDev.tv courses and then extended far beyond the tutorials with real predictive interception math, trails, explosions, and screen shake.

## Features

- True predictive targeting (intercept point calculated mathematically)
- Satisfying mid-air explosions with debris and screen shake
- Pixel-perfect missile trails
- Health/Score system
- One defender dome protecting the planet
- 100% C# (Godot 3.5 Mono)

<br>

## Built With

- **Godot Engine 3.5.3 (Mono / C#)**
- Predictive interception math (lead pursuit)
- Heavily modified assets from GameDev.tv courses
- Additional free assets (Kenney, etc.)

<br>

## Why This Exists

I wanted to go from “following tutorials” → “actually understanding how missile defense games work”.  
So I threw away the simple homing missiles from the course and implemented real intercept-point prediction instead.

Everything I learned here (trajectory math, clean C# architecture, juicy feedback) has been reused in my newer games.
